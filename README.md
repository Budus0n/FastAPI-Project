üåü Project Overview
Problem Statement:
Sepsis is a life-threatening condition caused by the body's response to infection. Early detection is critical for effective treatment.
Goals:
‚Ä¢	Develop a machine learning model to predict sepsis based on clinical features.
‚Ä¢	Ensure high model performance (precision, recall, F1-score).
Key Business Questions:
1.	What is the class distribution of sepsis in the dataset?
2.	What are the most important features influencing predictions?
3.	Can hyperparameter tuning enhance model performance?
Framework:
The CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) was adopted for this project.

üóÇÔ∏è Dataset Description
The dataset includes clinical data for ICU patients. Each row represents a patient, with features such as plasma glucose, blood pressure, and age.
Key Columns:
‚Ä¢	PRG: Plasma Glucose
‚Ä¢	PL: Blood Work Result-1
‚Ä¢	PR: Blood Pressure
‚Ä¢	SK: Blood Work Result-2
‚Ä¢	Age: Patient's Age
‚Ä¢	Sepsis: Target variable (1 = Sepsis, 0 = No Sepsis)
Preprocessing Steps:
1.	Handling missing and duplicate values.
2.	Outlier treatment and feature scaling.
3.	Feature selection and engineering.

üìà Results
Model	Accuracy	Precision	Recall	F1-Score
Logistic Regression	0.85	0.84	0.86	0.85
Random Forest	0.88	0.87	0.89	0.88
K-Nearest Neighbors	0.81	0.80	0.82	0.81
LightGBM	0.89	0.88	0.90	0.89
